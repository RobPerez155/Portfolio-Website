# Portfolio-Website
This is a portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It does not have a backend wired up but in the future I will be implementing a node back end. 

This portfolio was adapted from this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/owEHlDn0JYQ) by Harris Willian. Changes were made to the screen layout, color theme, and skills section.
